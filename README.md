##  About Me

I am an undergraduate Engineering student specializing in Electronics and Computer Science, with a strong passion for semiconductor technology, chip design, and core electronics. I am deeply interested in understanding how systems work — from transistors and circuits to software applications.

My goal is to grow as a well-rounded engineer by combining strong hardware fundamentals with software development skills. I continuously strive to improve my knowledge in VLSI, semiconductor devices, problem-solving, and modern programming practices.
